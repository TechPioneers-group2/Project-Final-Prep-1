## Conflict Plan
#### - We all decide to do our best in this project, And work as one person but if any conflict appears we will do a  very quick meeting to fix this misunderstanding. And if anyone tries to work alone we gonna tell him we are a team and you can't do everything alone, So we should work as a group. And to be at the same level of understanding  we will work together on Discord during work time and after work time if anyone wants to add something to his code he should tell the Tl to do this thing and all members have to agree, and he should explain this part of code in the next meeting. And if anyone isn't working with the team, I will send him a private message to see what's happening with him and try to encourage him to do his best. And if he/she didn't understand. I will contact TAs and will not merge his code until the TAs found a solution.

## Communication Plan
#### -we decided to be available to communicate from 10:00 AM to 2:00 pm on our Slack channel and we will use Discord for live meetings every day at 6:00 pm for two hours and at 10:00 AM we have a meeting with the instructor and TAs, we will take a break after one and half hour and no one will have tasks to do after the 7:00 PM else if he/she wants to do his/her work that he/she did not do it or if he/she wants to do his/her work because he had something important to do during working hours and the merged party will be at 10:00 pm as well. after hours we will communicate in Slack channel if there is an important thing and this is the same way will we use it on the weekend if we fall behind we will meet each other on Discord and find the problem after that and handle it as a team. We have already met to break the ice between us, to get to know each other more, so that the environment is more comfortable at work. That is why everyone's opinion will be heard, and each one on the team will have a point of view that he can always share.

## Work Plan
#### As a team we won't work dependently we will work to gather and the one who has the strength on any side will help the other one who has any problem in his/her task and we will manage our work using Trello
## Git Process
#### The project will be on GitHub and Azure.
#### I have already created an org on GitHub with two repositories one for the backend  and I shared it with the members via email so each team member will clone the repository and start working
#### Once the tasks are divided, each team member will clone the repository and start working on the sub-branch, and then once we finished our work we will push the work to the sub-branch after discussing it with each other
#### For sure we will use the pull request workflow while we are working on the project and all the team members will be able to review these PRs, also 2 team members will be able to merge the PRs, the team leader and one who made the PR
#### For the merging we will merge the PRs each day and we will discuss this point at our meetings in discord
